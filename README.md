# Splash-Screen
## Written in AutoHotkey v2 beta 13
Simulates text falling from the top of the screen and bouncing at the center until it settles, while changing colors.

Just edit the default parameter or pass in your own value when you call it.

You can edit the colors as you see fit.

Personally, I put it at the start of my main script so when the script runs, I know it successfully reloaded.
